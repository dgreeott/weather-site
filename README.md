Myweatherexperiment is a project where I learned how to access and manipulate data from an API. I utilized Bootstrap as the CSS front-end framework in this development. In this project, Axios was utilized to fetch the data from the OpenWeatherMap API. I then created hooks so that I could set the query of the API to the appropriate search. To do this, I created an if statement with the condition of the event is by hitting the key "Enter". A function will be run and extract the information for the entered city.

To start, search a city and then press "Enter", it will display the current temperature, today's forecast, hourly forecast, daily forecast, and a more detailed description of today's weather. All of the information will change to the correct weather forecast for the city you searched. The dates and times will adjust to the correct timezone. To do this, I used Moment.js to convert the date/time from the JSON file. Also, the icons will change according to thing to the status of the description given.

Lastly, I added another page to display COVID data onto a heat map of the United States. The development of this map was with AmCharts, and the data is coming from an array I made with data from an API. The next phase for the page is to connect the heat map with real-time data from a COVID API. Also, creating a way to search a certain state and get specific data about that state.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
